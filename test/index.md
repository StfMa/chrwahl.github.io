For the impatient, here's how to get a boilerplate Jekyll site up and running.

{% highlight bash %}
~ $ gem install jekyll
~ $ jekyll new myblog
~ $ cd myblog
~/myblog $ jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
{% endhighlight %}

That's nothing, though. The real magic happens when you start creating blog
posts, using the front-matter to control templates and layouts, and taking
advantage of all the awesome configuration options Jekyll makes available.
